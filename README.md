# Bulldozer-Price-Prediction-Time-Series-ML-Project

Hi everyone! I'm super excited to share with you my GitHub repository where I have worked on a ##time-series## data with 412698 records and 50 columns. This was a Kaggle competition data that has already been concluded, but I wanted to challenge myself and see how well I could do.

In this repository, you will find my code and notebooks where I followed a standard approach for EDA (cleaning, converting any data that was not numeric, filling up empty values), defined evaluation functions (RMSLE(custom), MAE, R^2), tested models on subsets of data to hypertune the ideal model (used ##RandomizedSearchCV## to hypertune), and finally predicted on the test data.

According to the custom evaluation metrics that Kaggle provided, my model scored in the ##top 30##! That's pretty awesome, right? But I think I could have done even better if I ran the model for more iterations. I only ran it for 20 iterations because of time constraints.

Another thing that I'm really proud of is that this was the first time I used ##Git and GitHub## to continuously commit the changes made in this repository. It was a great learning experience for me, and I faced many errors and solved them along the way.

I hope you find this repository useful and interesting. Feel free to check it out, fork it, star it, or leave me some feedback. I would love to hear from you and learn from your suggestions. Thanks for reading!
